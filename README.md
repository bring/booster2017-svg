# Creative SVG for Developers

### Workshop for [Booster 2017](https://www.boosterconf.no/talks/860) — Friday before lunch!

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be drawn up in graphics software or hand coded in an editor. In this workshop, we are going to do both! \o/ If your happy place is usually filled with code — and drawing sounds scary — this workshop is especially for you.

“But I can’t draw,” you say…? Sure you can! Because basic shapes and simple lines will do just fine. There is so much we can make without any classic drawing skills, and this is what we want to show you.

## Exercise #1: Warm up!

## Exercise #2: Get to know Inkscape

* Install [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/)
* File > Document properties > Set page size to 2000 x 500 px
* Play around with rectangles, circles, bezier curves and straight lines
* Save as Plain SVG
* Check out saved `.svg` in an editor and in a browser
* Look into cleaning up the code with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)

## Exercise #3: Create a landscape

Your task is to play around with drawing and writing SVG. Have fun! Use this [HTML & CSS to get you started](https://bring.github.io/booster2017-svg/). Delete the `<polygon>` and `<path>` to add your own mountains, oceans, or perhaps a city skyline? Go for any theme you feel like, or pick from the suggestions.

There is only one rule: Victor. Make him small or large, change his appearance, give him props or animate his arms. But you have to add him somewhere in your landscape.
